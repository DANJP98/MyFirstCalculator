# MyFirstCalculator

A simple and interactive calculator built in Java that allows the user to perform various mathematical operations. The calculator supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power calculation, square roots, trigonometric functions (sin, cos), and logarithmic calculations.

## Features

- **Basic operations**:
    - Addition (`+`)
    - Subtraction (`-`)
    - Multiplication (`*`)
    - Division (`/`)
    - Power (`^`)
    - Square Root (`√`)
- **Trigonometric functions**:
    - Sine (`sin`)
    - Cosine (`cos`)
- **Logarithmic function**:
    - Logarithm (`log`)

- **Error Handling**:
    - Prevents division by zero.
    - Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
    - Prevents power calculations with negative bases and decimal exponents.
    - Handles invalid inputs for logarithms (e.g., negative or zero input).

## Installation

To run this project locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MyFirstCalculator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd MyFirstCalculator
    ```

3. Compile the Java program:

    ```bash
    javac MyFirstCalculator.java
    ```

4. Run the program:

    ```bash
    java MyFirstCalculator
    ```

## Usage

Once the program is running, it will prompt you to select an operation from the list:
Please choose an operation: [+ - * / ^ √ sin cos log]

Please choose an operation: [+ - * / ^ √ sin cos log]

- Enter the operation you wish to perform.
- If the operation requires numbers (e.g., addition, subtraction), you will be prompted to enter them.
- The program will then display the result or an error message if there was an invalid operation or input.

## Example
Please choose an operation: [+ - * / ^ √ sin cos log] Enter first number: 5 Enter second number: 3 Result: 8.0
